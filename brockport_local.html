    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Department of Social Work, established on the Brockport campus in 1971, is part of
      the School of Education, Health and Human Services. The department offers an
      undergraduate major in social work accredited by the Council on Social Work Education
      (CSWE). The CSWE accredited status of the undergraduate program provides an
      opportunity for students to apply for advanced standing in many graduate social work
      programs, thereby completing the MSW degree in one full year. The Department also
      offers an accredited Master’s Degree in Social Work.
      SUNY Brockport and the undergraduate social work program take seriously the
      responsibility to provide students with a learning environment that fosters understanding
      and respect for diversity and difference without discrimination on the basis without
      regard to an individual's race, color, national origin, religion, creed, age, disability, sex,
      gender identity, sexual orientation, familial status, pregnancy, predisposing genetic
      characteristics, military status, domestic violence victim status, or criminal conviction
      and to model affirmation and respect for diversity and difference. </p>

      <h2>Social Work Depoartment Mission</h2>
      <p>The department of social work is committed to excellence in preparing ethical and competent
        professional social workers who foster the well-being of individuals, families, groups,
        organizations, and communities. Through teaching, service, and scholarship, the department
        promotes civic engagement in diverse societies. </p>
      <h2>Social Work Undergraduate Program Mission</h2>
      <p>Firmly grounded in the liberal arts tradition and informed by the person-in-environment
        and global perspectives, the undergraduate social work program at SUNY Brockport, is
        committed to the promotion of human rights, social, economic, and environmental
        justice, and the elimination of poverty and oppression. Through teaching, service, and
        scholarship, we strive to prepare competent, self-aware, ethical generalist social
        workers for evidence-based practice with diverse populations, advocating for the wellbeing of all people in our shared global community.</p>
      <h2>Definition of Generalist Practice</h2>
      <p><strong>Generalist social work practice</strong> refers to the knowledge base, professional values, and
        practice skills needed for the social work practitioner to intervene using a multi-level approach
        to assessment and intervention. It involves working in partnership with the client system to
        frame problems in a manner that assists the client system to meet goals. It seeks to identify
        and strengthen the maximum potential in individuals, groups, organizations, and communities
        and is committed to understanding and respecting the unique context of the client system
        and responding to issues of human diversity. The generalist social worker is able to use the
        framework and ethical guidelines of the NASW and IFSW codes of ethics with client systems
        and to promote social and economic justice. The generalist practitioner is able to use critical
        thinking and research informed practice to identify and intervene in a manner that
        strengthens the client system. </p>

    </div>
    <div id="Competencies">
    <h2>Competency 1 - Demonstrate Ethical and Professional Behavior</h2>
      <p>Social workers understand the value base of the profession and its ethical standards, as
        well as relevant laws and regulations that may impact practice at the micro, mezzo, and
        macro levels. Social workers understand frameworks of ethical decision-making and
        how to apply principles of critical thinking to those frameworks in practice, research, and
        policy arenas. Social workers recognize personal values and the distinction between
        personal and professional values. They also understand how their personal experiences
        and affective reactions influence their professional judgment and behavior. Social
        workers understand the profession’s history, its mission, and the roles and
        responsibilities of the profession. Social Workers also understand the role of other
        professions when engaged in interprofessional teams. Social workers recognize the
        importance of life-long learning and are committed to continually updating their skills to
        ensure they are relevant and effective. Social workers also understand emerging forms
        of technology and the ethical use of technology in social work practice. Social workers: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>make ethical decisions by applying the standards of the NASW Code of Ethics,
            relevant laws and regulations, models for ethical decision-making, ethical</li>
          <li>use reflection and self-regulation to manage personal values and maintain
            professionalism in practice situations;</li>
          <li>demonstrate professional demeanor in behavior; appearance; and oral, written,
            and electronic communication;</li>
          <li>use technology ethically and appropriately to facilitate practice outcomes; and</li>
          <li>use supervision and consultation to guide professional judgment and behavior.</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Competency 2 - Engage Diversity and Difference in Practice</h2>
      <p>Social workers understand how diversity and difference characterize and shape the
        human experience and are critical to the formation of identity. The dimensions of
        diversity are understood as the intersectionality of multiple factors including but not
        limited to age, class, color, culture, disability and ability, ethnicity, gender, gender
        identity and expression, immigration status, marital status, political ideology, race,
        religion/spirituality, sex, sexual orientation, and tribal sovereign status. Social workers
        understand that, as a consequence of difference, a person’s life experiences may
        include oppression, poverty, marginalization, and alienation as well as privilege, power,
        and acclaim. Social workers also understand the forms and mechanisms of oppression
        and discrimination and recognize the extent to which a culture’s structures and values,
        including social, economic, political, and cultural exclusions, may oppress, marginalize,
        alienate, or create privilege and power. Social workers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>apply and communicate understanding of the importance of diversity and
            difference in shaping life experiences in practice at the micro, mezzo, and macro
            levels;</li>
          <li>present themselves as learners and engage clients and constituencies as
            experts of their own experiences; and</li>
          <li>apply self-awareness and self-regulation to manage the influence of personal
            biases and values in working with diverse clients and constituencies.</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Competency 3 - Advance Human Rights and Social, Economic, and Environmental Justice</h2>
      <p>Social workers understand that every person regardless of position in society has
        fundamental human rights such as freedom, safety, privacy, an adequate standard of
        living, health care, and education. Social workers understand the global
        interconnections of oppression and human rights violations and are knowledgeable
        about theories of human need and social justice and strategies to promote social and
        economic justice and human rights. Social workers understand strategies designed to
        eliminate oppressive structural barriers to ensure that social goods, rights, and
        responsibilities are distributed equitably, and that civil, political, environmental,
        economic, social, and cultural human rights are protected. Social workers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>apply their understanding of social, economic, and environmental justice to
            advocate for human rights at the individual and system levels; and</li>
          <li>engage in practices that advance social, economic, and environmental justice.</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Competency 4 - Engage in Practice-informed Research and Research-informed Practice</h2>
      <p>Social workers understand quantitative and qualitative research methods and their respective
        roles in advancing a science of social work and in evaluating their practice. Social workers know
        the principles of logic, scientific inquiry, and culturally informed and ethical approaches to
        building knowledge. Social workers understand that evidence that informs practice derives from
        multi-disciplinary sources and multiple ways of knowing. They also understand the processes
        for translating research findings into effective practice. Social workers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>use practice experience and theory to inform scientific inquiry and research;</li>
          <li>apply critical thinking to engage in analysis of quantitative and qualitative
            research methods and research findings;</li>
          <li>use and translate research evidence to inform and improve practice, policy, and
            service delivery.</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Competency 5 - Engage in Policy Practice</h2>
      <p>Social workers understand that human rights and social justice, as well as social welfare
        and services, are mediated by policy and its implementation at the federal, state, and
        local levels. Social workers understand the history and current structures of social
        policies and services, the role of policy in service delivery, and the role of practice in
        policy development. Social workers understand their role in policy development and
        implementation within their practice settings at the micro, mezzo, and macro levels and
        they actively engage in policy practice to effect change within those settings. Social
        workers recognize and understand the historical, social, cultural, economic,
        organizational, environmental, and global influences that affect social policy. They are
        also knowledgeable about policy formulation, analysis, implementation, and evaluation.
        Social workers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identify social policy at the local, state, and federal level that impacts well-being,
          service delivery, and access to social services;</li>
          <li>assess how social welfare and economic policies impact the delivery of and
            access to social services;</li>
          <li>apply critical thinking to analyze, formulate, and advocate for policies that
            advance human rights and social, economic, and environmental justice.</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Competency 6 - Engage with Individuals, Families, Groups, Organizations, and, Communities</h2>
      <p>Social workers understand that engagement is an ongoing component of the dynamic
        and interactive process of social work practice with, and on behalf of, diverse
        individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. Social workers value the
        importance of human relationships. Social workers understand theories of human
        behavior and the social environment, and critically evaluate and apply this knowledge to
        facilitate engagement with clients and constituencies, including individuals, families,
        groups, organizations, and communities. Social workers understand strategies to
        engage diverse clients and constituencies to advance practice effectiveness. Social
        workers understand how their personal experiences and affective reactions may impact
        their ability to effectively engage with diverse clients and constituencies. Social workers
        value principles of relationship-building and interprofessional collaboration to facilitate
        engagement with clients, constituencies, and other professionals as appropriate. Social
        workers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>apply knowledge of human behavior and the social environment, person-inenvironment, and other multidisciplinary theoretical frameworks to engage with
            clients and constituencies; and</li>
          <li>use empathy, reflection, and interpersonal skills to effectively engage diverse
            clients and constituencies.</li>
        </ul>
